Popular Vote
=========

## Project Description

Popular Vote is a full stack web app built with NodeJS and run on an Express server. PostgreSQL is used to update and query the database of emails, questions and votes.  

!["Enter your email."](home page)
!["Ask a question and suggest options to vote on with optional description."](poll page)
!["Drag and drop your votes. Make sure the one you liek the best is at the top and the one you like the least is at the bottom. Then hit submit!"](voted)
!["Only the admin can view the results."](results)

Images depict the login page (top), where you can submit a link for 'tiny-fying' (middle), as well as your list of saved tiny URLs (bottom).


## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
